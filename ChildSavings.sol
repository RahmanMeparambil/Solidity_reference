// This contract allows a grandfather (or owner) to add funds to his grandchildren's savings accounts. 
// The funds can be deposited into the children's accounts by the owner (or any authorized address) until 
// the children are old enough to access the funds.
// 
// Key Features:
// - The contract stores an array of children, each with their own wallet address and savings balance.
// - The `addKid` function allows the owner to add a new child (grandchild) to the system with an initial balance of 0.
// - The `addFund` function is payable, allowing the owner to send Ether to a specific child's account.
// - The `findIndex` function is used internally to locate the child based on their wallet address.
// - Each childâ€™s savings are updated when Ether is sent to their account via `addFund`.
// - A simple check ensures that Ether is sent when calling `addFund`, preventing zero-value deposits.
//
// Usage:
// 1. The owner adds children to the contract using the `addKid` function.
// 2. The owner sends Ether to a specific child using the `addFund` function, where the funds are added to the child's savings.
// 3. The balance of each child can be checked with the `balanceOf` function.
// 4. The money can be withrawed by the kid with the 'withdraw' function.
